INSTALL NODE and execute npm install uglifyjs-folder -g

afterwards in cmd place the command: uglifyjs-folder js -o all.min.js

COPY content from all.min.js to bottom index.html (@ comment Compressed). 

DO this every code update in the /js folder

NOTE FROM SKUD: Please put the code into a file named psmin_999.js (psmin_[some numbers go here]) instead to not break the usual minify script functionality. 
You should be able to get the usual script to work in windows by using a bash shell or powershell in VSCode terminal.
I recommend not pushing the psmin_999 file used.
